Each letter in the input word should be replaced with a different letter in the alphabet. The same substitution should be applied to every letter in every input word. The exact cipher key used is unknown, but it should have the following properties:\\n\\n- Each letter in the alphabet should map to a different letter (i.e. no letter should be mapped to itself or to another mapping in the same word).\\n- The same mapping should always be used for each letter (i.e. a given letter should always be mapped to the same substitute letter, regardless of where it appears in the input word).\\n\\nBased on the input-output pairs given, it is possible to infer some of the mappings used by the cipher. For example, we know that:\\n\\n- \"p\" maps to \"f\"\\n- \"e\" maps to \"r\"\\n- \"a\" maps to \"e\"\\n- \"t\" maps to \"d\"\\n- \"h\" maps to \"r\"\\n- \"i\" maps to \"i\"\\n- \"n\" maps to \"n\"\\n- \"k\" maps to \"g\"\\n- \"b\" maps to \"r\"\\n- \"e\" maps to \"o\"\\n- \"a\" maps to \"t\"\\n- \"n\" maps to \"i\"\\n- \"m\" maps to \"s\"\\n- \"s\" maps to \"u\"\\n- \"t\" maps to \"c\"\\n- \"o\" maps to \"f\"\\n- \"r\" maps to \"m\"\\n\\nUsing this information, we can attempt to construct the full cipher key by trial and error. For example, we might guess that \"c\" maps to \"v\" based on the fact that \"t\" maps to \"c\" and \"v\" is the only unused letter left. We could then check if this mapping produces the correct output for some of the other input words. If it does not, we would need to try a different mapping for \"c\". By repeating this process for all letters, we could eventually construct the full cipher key.']\n",
